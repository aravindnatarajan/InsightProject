very common for a cashier to scrutinize the banknotes you use to pay a bill. don't be offended; they are not suggesting that you're using counterfeit currency. they just need to be responsible. when you get change, do the same, scrutinize the banknotes you get, especially notes over Â¥50. salespeople may try to give you counterfeit money that they took from other customers as change. counterfeits from atms became a hot topic in recent years, although it is not common. if you are worried, withdraw your money from the bank counter and say "i worry about jiabi (counterfeit)". bank staff
