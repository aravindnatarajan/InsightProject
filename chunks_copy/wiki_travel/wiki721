in many countries, especially in asia. the hong kong dollar, u.s. dollar, canadian dollar, euro, british pound, australian dollar, japanese yen and south korean won can be easily changed in china. southeast asian currencies are generally not accepted, the exception being singapore dollars. currency should only be changed at major banks (bank of china in particular) or with the licensed money changers usually found at airports or high end hotels although these offer very bad rates. a black market for currency exchange does exist but you are highly advised to avoid as counterfeiting is a major issue when exchanging money
