bigbrand label on them, and make a great profit. these may or may not be a good buy, but in any case they are not what you would expect from bigbrand. finally, of course, some other factory may be cranking out utterly bogus "bigbrand" shirts. these outright forgeries often misspell the brand name which is a dead giveaway. fake brand oddities include items such as a reversible jacket with "adidas" on one side and "nike" on the other or shirts with more than one brand. while these might be interesting curiosities, they obviously are not genuine examples of either brand.
