stores and other businesses will close for several days, a week, or even longer, so unless you have close friends or relatives in china, it is not ideal to visit during this period. also, during early july university students (twenty-odd million of them!) go home and in late august they return to school, jamming transportation options especially between the east coast and the western regions of sichuan, gansu, tibet, and xinjiang. a complete list of chinese festivals would be very long since many areas or ethnic groups have their own local ones. see listings for individual towns for details. here
