about this incessantly. foreign teachers generally earn two or three times their chinese colleagues' salaries but the differences are gradually narrowing. a public college or university will often pay less than a private school, but will also require fewer teaching hours. make certain you understand your employer's policies on outside work as some are quite restrictive. the standard government-provided contract[57], which most schools use (perhaps amended a bit), prohibits it enitirely unless you get permission from the employer. if you plan to work as a teacher in china, research very carefully. you might get your dream job or a nightmare.
