well. insurance is not provided by the motorbike renters so you are responsible for any damage. if you do hit a local person, either on foot, on motorcycle, or in a car, you can expect to pay a very large sum of money to make restitution. street signs are infrequent and ambiguous. if you are not familiar with the road system and comfortable riding a motorbike at home then this may be ill advised and dangerous to learn. thoroughly check your travel insurance policy to ensure that your cover is still in place whilst operating or riding upon a motor
