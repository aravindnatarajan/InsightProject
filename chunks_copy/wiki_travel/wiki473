never use profanity, even when someone does something that warrants it. never swear during an argument. you will lose the argument immediately as they will act offended that you swore and claim that you are "abusing" them.. profanity makes you look bad in india so avoid it when you can. there is a huge difference between how indians treat one another on the street and at home. indian culture is inward thinking. in their homes everyone is a guest and treated incredibly well. strangers on the street however are treated with complete indifference and without what westerns call "common courtesy."
