are actually a fairly recent tradition with most of the designs being taken from middle-eastern traditions rather than reflecting chinese designs. be aware that though the workmanship is quite fine on these carpets they often skimp on materials, particularly dyes. these are prone to fading and color change, especially if the carpet is displayed in a brightly lit place. some excellent wool carpets are also made in china. tibetan carpets are amongst the best in terms of quality and construction, but be aware that most carpets described as tibetan are not actually made in tibet, with a few notable exceptions.
