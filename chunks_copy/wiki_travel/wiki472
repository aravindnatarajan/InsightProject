if you move to metropolitan cities, there is much more liberalism of wearing western outfits and skimpy clothes though still they may become a centre of stare from men. but they should avoid moving alone at night. keep in mind that indians will consider themselves obliged to go out of the way to fulfill a guest's request and will insist very strongly that it is no inconvenience to do so, even if it is not true. this of course means that there is a reciprocal obligation on you as a guest to take extra care not to be a burden.
