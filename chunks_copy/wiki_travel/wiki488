a reasonably long time, you can buy a prepaid sim with lifetime validity and then topup with talktime as per your needs. please note that in most such cases, you will need to topup atleast once every six months to keep the sim active. and the term lifetime is slightly misleading as it refers to the life of the license issued to the operator by the government of india to provide mobile services. if the license is renewed, your services shall continue without any additional charges but if the license is not renewed, your lifetime sim also becomes defunct. licenses
