area to start offering a wide range of accommodation is uluwatu which now boasts everything from surfer bungalows to the opulent bulgari hotel. further north on the west coast is the district of canggu, which offers many traditional villages set among undulating ricefields and a good range of accommodation. for rest and revitalisation, visit amed, an area of peaceful fishing villages on the east coast with some good hotels and restaurants, or head for the sparsely populated areas of west bali. thanks to bali's balmy climate, many hotels, bungalows and villas offer open-air bathrooms, often set in a lush garden.
