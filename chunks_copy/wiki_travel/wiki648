take a snooze. coaches are often a better, though more expensive option than trains. bus personnel tend to try to be helpful, but they are much less familiar with foreigners than airline personnel and english ability is very rare. some coaches have toilets, but they are frequently dirty and using them can be difficult as the bus turns a corner and water in the basin splashes around. a coach or bus in rural china is a different experience altogether. signs in the station to identify buses will only be in chinese or another local language, routes may also be posted
