you pay for applies here. there are, of course, exceptions, but a 4 bedroom villa offered for us$400 and one for us$800 per night will be different in many ways—the standard of maintenance, the number of staff and their english ability, and the overall quality of furnishings and fittings in the property. look carefully as to who is running the villa. is it run by the owner, a local company, a western company or by local staff who answer to an absent overseas owner? and who you are renting through—directly from the owner, a management company, an established villa agent
