is also important. much has been made of the confusing indian head nod for yes and no, but the only important thing to understand is that indians have different nods for yes, ok and no. if they are nodding their head up and down, they mean yes or i agree, as in a standard nod. if they are shaking their head in a tilting motion from right to left and back (like a figure of eight), they mean i understand or i get what you said. if they shake their head sideways (left to right to left), they mean no.
