emporium in new delhi, where you can sample wares from all across the country in air-conditioned comfort. although you will pay a little more at these stores, you can be sure that what you are getting is not a cheap knockoff. the harder you bargain, the more you save money. a few tries later, you will realise that it is fun. often, the more time you spend in a store, the better deals you will get. it is worth spending time getting to know the owner, asking questions, and getting him to show you other products (if you are interested).
