they look amazing and are definitely a very balinese experience, but they may also shelter little uninvited guests and are best avoided if you have a low tolerance for critters. bali hotel prices may be given in three different currencies. prices in u.s. dollars are most common, particularly away from the budget sector. euros are sometimes used, particularly at hotels owned by european nationals. lower-end places usually (but not always) price in indonesian rupiah. if you pay your bill by credit card, then the amount in the currency you agreed to when making the booking is converted to indonesian rupiah
