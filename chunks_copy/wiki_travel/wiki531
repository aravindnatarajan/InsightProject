foreigners are almost never targets in china and you will be treated with great respect provided you don't act recklessly. noise means life, and china is rooted in a community based culture, so you may want to bring earplugs for long bus or train rides! pushing, shoving and/or jumping queues: this often occurs anywhere where there are queues, (or lack thereof) particularly at train stations. again, often there simply are no queues at all. therefore, queue jumping is a major problem in china. best bet is to pick a line that looks like its moving or just wait for everyone
