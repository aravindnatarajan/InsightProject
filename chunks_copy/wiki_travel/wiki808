once you pick a piece, you are obliged to take it. don't put it back. confucius says never leave someone what you don't want. when someone is picking from a dish, don't try to cross over or go underneath his arms to pick from a dish further away. wait until they finish picking. in most cases, a dish is not supposed to be picked simultaneously by more than one person. don't try to compete with anyone to pick a piece from the same dish. don't put your chopsticks vertically into your bowl of rice as it is reminiscent of incense
