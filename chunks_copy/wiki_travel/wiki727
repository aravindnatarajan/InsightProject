flat fee. note: minsheng bank, shenzhen development bank, and bank of shanghai atms will sometimes display plus/cirrus/maestro logos. in reality, only selected atms of theirs are linked into these networks, and there is usually no indication until you try. this is true of many other banks' atms, even agricultural bank of china (one of the big four). before traveling, find out if your home bank charges a currency conversion fee (often between 0-3%) on such transactions. it is worth opening a zero conversion fee account beforehand if possible. otherwise it would be better to open a local account on arrival
