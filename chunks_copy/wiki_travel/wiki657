for drivers to cheat visitors by deliberately selecting a longer route, it is not that common, and usually shouldn't be a nuisance. when it does happen, the fare difference will usually be minimal. however, should you feel you have been seriously cheated on the way to your hotel, and you are staying at a mid- or high-range hotel that has a doorman, you can appeal to him and/or the desk staff for assistance: a single sharp sentence pointing out the deception may resolve the issue. also beware of taxi hawkers who stalk naive travelers inside or just outside the airport
