by car[edit] driving on your own[edit] in india driving is on the left of the road â€” some of the time. you can drive in india if you have a local license or an international driving permit, but unless you are accustomed to driving on extremely chaotic streets, you probably will not want to. the average city or village road is narrow, often potholed and badly marked. national highways are better, but they are still narrow, and indian driving discipline is non-existent. in the past few years the central government has embarked on an ambitious project to upgrade the highways.
