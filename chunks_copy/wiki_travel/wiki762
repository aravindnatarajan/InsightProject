goods can be a very good buy. however, none of them are worth anywhere near the price of real top-quality goods. unless you are an expert on whatever you want to buy, you are quite likely to get sold low quality merchandise at high prices. there are two solutions. either stick to the cheaper products, some of which are quite nice as keepsakes, or if you do decide to spend a substantial amount, then deal with a large and reputable vendor; you may not get the bargains an expert could find elsewhere, but you probably won't get cheated either. clothing[edit]
