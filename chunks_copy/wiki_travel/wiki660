and pick up multiple passengers if their destinations are in the same general direction. each passenger pays full fare but it saves the time of waiting for an empty cab at rush hour. even in major cities like shanghai or beijing, you are very unlikely to find an english-speaking taxi driver, though beijing made progress toward this in preparation for the olympics, and shanghai has made some progress due to the world expo. anywhere else it is basically impossible. if you try say the name of your destination in mandarin (but with your native pronunciation), you may not be understood.
