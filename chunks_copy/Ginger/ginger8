gingerbread man you look so good. i mean tired. please stay awhile and rest if you like." as the dog talked, he stepped closer and closer. the closer he stepped, the more nervous became the little gingerbread man. when the butterfly flitted from her grass perch in alarm, the little gingerbread man took off running with the dog nipping at his tiny heels. he shouted, "i outran children. i outran a horse, and i'll outrun you, too. run, run as fast as you can. you can't catch me. i'm the gingerbread man." and truly that dog could not catch him.
