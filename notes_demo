1. I got interested in ASL because there are a lot of deaf events in Pittsburgh where I used to live. So I started to learnt the language and I saw these very young kids signing so fluently - they couldn't speak or even spell, but they had no trouble communicating. SO I thought it would be nice to make a teaching program that could be used in schools to teach kids English and science through ASL. I've always been interested in teaching, and where best to make a difference than at the grass roots level.

The Data . . . 

The objective is - given a sign
