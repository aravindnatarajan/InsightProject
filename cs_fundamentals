CS Fundamentals:

Data structures and Algorithms.
Important:  Recursion. Understanding sorting.

Given a matrix:
Has numbers in different cells.

1	2	4	5	-
-	3	-1	-	7
-	-	-	-	-


Question: find the sum of all elements in a smaller matrix, but do it efficiently.
1	2	3
4	5	6
7	8	9

sum matrix:
1	3	6
5	12	21
12	27	45

5 + 6 + 8 + 9 = 45 - 6 - 12 + 1 

Check if 2 trees are the same through recursion.

Graphs:

Node  {
  int val;
  neighbors [];
}
