bunched-up leaves used to brew it (the chinese name "pearl tea" is rather more poetic) jasmine tea (茉莉花茶 mòlihuachá): green-tea scented with jasmine flowers oolong (烏龍 wūlóng): a half-fermented mountain tea. however, specialist tea houses serve a vast variety of brews, ranging from the pale, delicate white tea (白茶 báichá) to the powerful fermented and aged pu'er tea (普洱茶 pǔ'ěrchá). tea in chinese culture is akin to wine in western culture, and even the same type of tea will come in many different grades. always check prices carefully before ordering as some of the best varieties can be very pricey
