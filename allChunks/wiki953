for china mobile's "12593" or china unicom's "17911" service; both require a simple application with no deposit requirement. usually there will be an english speaker, and let him/her know what you want. ask for the "special" dialing code, and for 1rmb/month extra on china mobile (free on china unicom), this will be provided to you. enter the code, the country code, then the local number and you will be talking cheaply in no time. don't be fooled by cellphone shops with the china mobile signage, be sure to go a to a location. the employee's will wear a blue uniform
